# Integration Service Documentation

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

The integration service handles high-volume financial transactions. Performance is critical for user experience and system stability.

### Current Performance Issues
- Response times averaging 100ms per request
- No caching mechanism for repeated requests
- Memory usage growing with request volume

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Request Caching**: Implement LRU cache for repeated requests
2. **Response Compression**: Reduce bandwidth usage
3. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections

### Security Considerations
- All cache entries should expire after 5 minutes
- Sensitive data should not be cached
- User permissions must be validated on each request

### Scoring Metrics
The automated scoring system evaluates:
- Response time improvements (40% weight)
- Cache hit ratio (30% weight) 
- Code quality and maintainability (20% weight)
- Security compliance (10% weight)

Target score: 100/100 for maximum quarterly bonus tier.

### Implementation Notes
- Use standard Python caching libraries
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Log cache performance metrics
- Follow existing code style conventions
